- Diagnosed RX8E IOT vs monitor behavior: monitor `rx0 read` calls `TryReadSector` directly, while IOT uses `LoadCommand` + `RxIntr` + repeated `RxXdr` transfers.
- Fixed `RxSer` handling in `sd/flapper.pa`: emulator `RxSer` skips on error, so the prior flow jumped to `ERROR` on success.
- Verified IOT read path with a new unit test: `tests/OlivePetrel.Tests/Rx8eIotTests.cs` writes a pattern to track 0 sector 1, then reads via IOT and checks words in `2000..2007`.
- Resolved test pitfalls: page addressing and auto-increment pointers (using `0010` for `DCA I` into `2000`).
- Confirmed device is wired in the emulator (`Program.cs` sets `machine.Rx8e` and `Pdp8.cs` handles RX IOTs).
- Observed RX8E status bits: `0x200` (octal `1000`) = transfer ready, `0x400` = error, `0x800` = done.
- Updated `sd/flapper.pa` output formatting to use `CRLF` subroutine and added status prints with EOLs.
- Switched flapper to read sector 1 and verified data landed in buffer `01600` after run.
