# Devlog 2025-12-17

## Summary
- Built a PDP-8 emulator core with an interactive monitor, octal loader/saver, and memory/register controls.
- Added TC08 two-reel support with attach/show commands, plus block read/write for 129-word frames.
- Added console device entries (TTI/TTO) to device listing and a Linux publish shortcut.

## Monitor Commands Added/Updated
- `dep <addr> <word|string>...` supports octal words and ASCII strings with escapes.
- `save <file>` writes core memory as `<addr>: <word0> ... <word7>` lines.
- `load <file>` accepts `<addr>:` line prefixes (and still accepts `@addr`).
- `att dt0|dt1 <file> [new]` attaches or creates DECtape images.
- `show dev` shows device numbers and TC08 attachment state.
- `show dt` shows TC08 drive status.
- `dt0|dt1 read <block> <addr>` reads one 129-word block to memory.
- `dt0|dt1 write <block> <addr>` writes one 129-word block from memory (checksum word forced to 0).

## Files Touched
- `OlivePetrel.csproj` (target framework bumped to net9.0)
- `Pdp8.cs` (loader parsing updated for `<addr>:` format)
- `Program.cs` (monitor commands, help text, device listing)
- `Tc08.cs` (attach/create and block I/O)
- `build-linux.ps1` (publish shortcut)

## Notes
- Tape image format: octal block numbers starting at 0; blocks are 128 data words + 1 checksum word.
- Example tape file created with DECtape tool: `media/fish0.tu56`.
